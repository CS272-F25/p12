# p12 - Bucky's Brewers

## Bucky's Brew - https://cs272-f25.github.io/p12/

Bucky's Brew is an online coffee shop that sells coffee and coffee related
products, such as coffee beans, mugs, and brewing equipment. Users will be able
to explore our items, add products to their cart, and somewhat, go through the
checkout process. We’ll have a few pages for shopping, one to contact us, and
one for checkout. We plan to create an almost functional checkout page, with a
function to add things to the cart, and the possibility to see them in the cart,
along with a way to fill out information to checkout.

## Code Formating

For consistent code formatting we will be using Prettier - Code formatter :
https://prettier.io/

On VisualStudio Marketplace:
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode

On OpenVSX: https://open-vsx.org/extension/esbenp/prettier-vscode

After this plugin is installed it should read the configuration file from this
repo and will auto format your code on save.
