## For Developers

### Code Formating

For consistent code formatting we will be using Prettier - Code formatter :
<https://prettier.io/>

On VisualStudio Marketplace:
<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode>

On OpenVSX: <https://open-vsx.org/extension/esbenp/prettier-vscode>

After this plugin is installed it should read the configuration file from this
repo and will auto format your code on save.
